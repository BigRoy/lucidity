paths:

  # ==============
  # Best Practices
  # ==============

  # Define common path definitions to use as shorthand in order to avoid repetitive and
  # verbose templates. This also makes it easy to change any of the common root paths
  # and have the changes apply to all templates that use them.
  documents:
    pattern: "{project.name}/documents/"
  asset_nested:
    pattern: "{asset.parent_group}/{asset.name}"

  # Nest path definitions to reduce this even further.
  asset_root:
    pattern: "{project.name}/assets/model/{@asset_nested}"
  sequence_root:
    pattern: "{project.name}/assets/shots/{@asset_nested}"
  render_root:
    pattern: "{project.name}/assets/renders/{@asset_nested}"

  # Name with a readable and easily reusable prefix when there's many definition required
  # within a category to be clear with your path definitions.
  doc.contracts:
    pattern: "{@documents}/contracts/"
  doc.notes:
    pattern: "{@documents}/contracts/"
  doc.schedule:
    pattern: "{@documents}/schedule/"
  doc.brief:
    pattern: "{@documents}/brief/"

  # You can also define additional settings for the template
  project_config:
    pattern: "{project.name}/backup/{project.name}.config"
    mode: "strict"
    anchor: "end"
